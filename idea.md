## What Makes This Different

Traditional chess is about calculating moves and tactics. This version adds a psychological layer: **your pieces have personalities, moods, and opinions**. You have to manage their morale and sometimes convince them to follow your orders.

---

## The Basic Gameplay

### The Group Chat
Instead of silently moving pieces, you play chess through a group chat where all your pieces are present. You tag pieces to give them orders, they respond, and sometimes they refuse.

**Example:**
- You: "@Knight move to f3"
- Knight: "Finally getting some action! On my way!" ✓
- You: "@Pawn move forward and attack their Queen"
- Pawn: "That's suicide! I'll die instantly. No way." ✗
- You: "Trust me, their Queen will have to retreat, opening up our attack"
- Pawn: "...Fine. But you better be right about this."

### The Morale System
Every piece has a morale score (0-100) that determines their willingness to follow orders.

**Morale goes DOWN when:**
- You sacrifice their friends
- You leave them undefended
- You make bad moves with them
- They sit idle for too long
- They get endangered repeatedly

**Morale goes UP when:**
- They successfully capture enemy pieces
- You protect them from danger
- They participate in clever tactics
- You compliment them
- They're positioned well

**High morale** = Pieces obey instantly, play confidently
**Low morale** = Pieces question orders, might refuse risky moves, need persuasion

### Piece Personalities

Each piece type has a distinct personality that affects how they react:

**Pawns:** Naive and eager, want to please, scared of combat but willing to sacrifice
**Knights:** Cocky mavericks, love flashy moves, hate retreating
**Bishops:** Intellectual strategists, want logical explanations, cautious
**Rooks:** Loyal soldiers, disciplined, obey orders unless morale is very low
**Queen:** Confident diva, expects protection, refuses suicide moves unless convinced
**King:** Nervous leader, compliments pieces that protect him, panics in check

### Persuasion
When a piece refuses your command, you enter a persuasion phase:

**Text persuasion:** Type your argument in chat
- "This move forks their Queen and Rook"
- "We'll lose the game if you don't do this"
- "I promise I'll protect you after"

**Voice Integration:** Speak your case (turn-based, happens in real-time during your turn)
- Do speech to text (for group chat itself)

**Success depends on:**
- Is your logic sound? (Does the move actually do what you claim?)
- Does it match their personality? (Knights like "glory", Bishops like "tactical advantage")
- Their current morale level
- Have you lied to them before?

**If they still refuse:** Pick a different piece or accept their compromise move

### The Opponent's King
Your opponent's King is in the chat too, actively taunting you:

**When you lose a piece:** "Lost your Knight? How careless."
**When you blunder:** "Did you just hang your Queen? Wow."
**When you're in check:** "Run, little King, run!"
**When they're winning:** "This is almost too easy."
**When they're losing:** "A lucky move. This isn't over."

Your King also responds to boost morale or show worry.

### AI Analysis
After every move, an AI analyst comments in the chat:

"✓ Strong opening. Knight develops actively. Morale boost: Knight +10"
"⚠️ Warning: Their Bishop threatens your Rook on a1"
"💡 Suggestion: Castle soon for King safety"
"📊 Board evaluation: You're up +1.5 (winning)"
"🚨 That was a blunder! You left your Queen undefended. All pieces morale -5"

This helps players learn and adds commentary to the game.

## Game Modes

### Player vs Player
- Both players have their own group chat with their pieces
- Can't see opponent's piece conversations
- Both deal with morale and persuasion
- Both Kings taunt each other
- Pieces can have custom personalities (Space Marines, Historical Generals, etc.)

### Player vs AI
- You manage your pieces normally
- AI controls opponent pieces (they obey instantly BUT have morale)
- Low morale AI pieces occasionally blunder
- High morale AI pieces play stronger
- AI King taunts you based on board position

---

## Custom Pieces

### Preset Templates
Before the game starts, choose from different chess variants:

**Classic Chess:** Normal 8x8 chess

**Power Chess:** Replace some pieces with hybrids
- Chancellor (Rook + Knight combined movement)
- Archbishop (Bishop + Knight combined movement)
- Amazon (Queen + Knight combined movement)

**Leaper Madness:** Add exotic jumping pieces
- Camel (jumps 3-then-1, like Knight's 2-then-1)
- Nightrider (can make multiple Knight jumps in one move)

**Hopper Havoc:** Pieces that jump over others
- Grasshopper (moves like Queen but must hop over a piece)
- Cannon (moves like Rook, captures by jumping over a piece)

**Pawn Revolution:** 
- Berolina Pawns (move diagonally, capture straight - opposite of normal)

Each special piece has unique personality traits matching their movement style.

### Custom Generation
Create your own themed pieces:

**Example:** "Make my Pawns Space Marines from Warhammer 40K"

AI generates:
- Visual description
- Personality: Zealous, fearless, never refuses forward moves
- Custom dialogue: "For the Emperor!" "We know no fear!"
- Behavioral traits: Morale never drops below 50, +20 morale for any attack

**Surprise mode:** Opponent doesn't see your custom pieces until they move

## What Makes a Turn Feel Different

**Traditional chess turn:**
1. Think about move
2. Click piece, click destination
3. Done

**Chess 2026 turn:**
1. Think about move
2. Tag piece in chat: "@Knight, move to f3"
3. Knight responds: "Good idea! Controlling the center."
4. Piece moves
5. AI comments: "Strong development. Knight morale +10. Opponent's Queen looks vulnerable."
6. Opponent's King: "Predictable opening."
7. Think about next move, consider which pieces have high morale...

**If your move is risky:**
1. Tag piece: "@Pawn, capture their Knight"
2. Pawn: "I'll die! Their Rook is covering that square!"
3. You: "Yes, but it's a trade. We're up material."
4. Pawn: "...I don't want to die..."
5. You (voice): [Speaks with urgency] "We need this! Trust me!"
6. AI calculates... Success!
7. Pawn: "Fine! For the team!"
8. Piece moves and gets captured
9. Opponent captures back
10. AI: "Good trade. You're up material (+3). But your Queen feels nervous about the sacrifice: -5 morale"

## The Psychological Strategy

Beyond chess tactics, you now manage:

**Army morale:** Keep pieces happy so they obey in critical moments
**Persuasion skills:** Learn what arguments work for each personality type
**Relationship building:** Protect pieces early so they trust you later
**Sacrifice timing:** Low-morale pieces are easier to sacrifice (they're already demoralized)
**Emotional reads:** If your opponent's pieces are chatty and confident, they might be winning

---

## Why It's Fun

**Party game appeal:**
- Hilarious moments when pieces rebel
- Reading your pieces' snarky responses
- Voice arguments with digital chess pieces
- Opponent King trash talk
- Watching your friend beg their Queen to move

**Strategic depth:**
- Classic chess skill still matters
- Added layer: morale management
- Timing sacrifices when morale is high
- Predicting when pieces will refuse
- Using psychology alongside tactics

**Learning tool:**
- AI explains why moves are good/bad
- Pieces give feedback on positioning
- Analysis after every move
- Learn chess while being entertained

**Customization:**
- Play as Space Marines vs Medieval Knights
- Try weird chess variants with hybrid pieces
- Create themed armies
- Surprise opponents with custom personalities

## The Core Loop Summary

1. Your turn starts
2. Look at the board, decide on a move
3. Check which pieces have good morale
4. Tag a piece in chat with your command
5. Piece responds (agrees or refuses)
6. If refused: persuade via text/voice or pick different piece
7. Move executes, board updates
8. AI analyzes the move, comments on quality and morale changes
9. Opponent's King might taunt you
10. Repeat for opponent's turn
11. Morale resets between games

The game ends like normal chess (checkmate, stalemate, resignation), but getting there involves managing personalities, maintaining morale, persuading reluctant pieces, enduring taunts, and getting real-time feedback on your play.

That's the complete idea: **Chess + personality management + group chat interface + psychological warfare + AI commentary + custom pieces**. A social, strategic, hilarious twist on traditional chess.
